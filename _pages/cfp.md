The Foundations of Applied Software Engineering for Games workshop (FASE4Games’25) aims to share innovative research contributions in software-engineering methods that address the current challenges in game development, including entertainment games, serious games, and gamified applications.


Challenges to be discussed in FASE4Games’25 include, but are not limited to:

- **Artificial intelligence for software engineering** applied to games.
- **Software engineering for artificial intelligence** in games.
- **Debugging and fault localization** applied to games.
- **Distributed and collaborative software engineering** for game development.
- **Empirical software engineering** applied to games.
- **Human and social aspects of software engineering** in game development.
- **Human-computer interaction** in games.
- **Mining software repositories** for game development insights.
- **Mobile game development**.
- **Model-driven engineering** applied to games.
- **Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems** in games.
- **Performance engineering** for games.
- **Program analysis** for games.
- **Program comprehension** in game development.
- **Program repair** in games.
- **Programming languages** for game development.
- **Recommendation systems** in games.
- **Requirements engineering** for games.
- **Search-based software engineering** applied to games.
- **Services, components, and cloud** in game development.
- **Software architectures** for games.
- **Software engineering education** using games.
- **Software evolution** in game development.
- **Software processes** for games.
- **Software testing** for games.
- **Tools and environments** for game development.


## Important Dates

- **Papers submission:** Tuesday, Feb 25th, 2025  
- **Papers notification:** Tuesday, Mar 25th, 2025  
- **Papers camera-ready:** Thursday, Apr 24th, 2025  

## Papers Submission

Submissions are accepted as follows:

- **Long research papers:** 8 pages (including references)
- **Short research papers:** 5 pages (including references)

Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the `acmsmall` option. We strongly encourage the use of the `review`, `screen`, and `anonymous` options as well. In summary, use the following LaTeX document class:  

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

Papers must be submitted electronically through the EasyChair site: **[https://fase4games25.hotcrp.com/](https://fase4games25.hotcrp.com/)**  

Each submission will be reviewed by at least **three members** of the program committee. The review process will determine if the submission is accepted or rejected.  

Submissions will be evaluated based on:  

- Originality  
- Importance of contribution  
- Soundness  
- Evaluation (if relevant)  
- Quality of presentation  
- Appropriate comparison to related work  

In addition to declaring topics relevant to their submissions, authors will also be asked to declare the research methods employed. This ensures reviewer expertise in both research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, refer to the [SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/form_generator/Checklist.html).  

**Note:** The names and ordering of authors in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the submitted version.  

FASE4Games requires that **at least one author** of each accepted paper register for and physically attend the FASE4Games workshop to present their results.  

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.
