<!-- [Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc](http://www.ptidej.net/Members/guehenyg) has been a full professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Concordia University since 2017, where he leads the Ptidej team on evaluating and enhancing the quality of the software systems, focusing on the Internet of Things and researching new theories, methods, and tools to understand, evaluate, and improve the development, release, testing, and security of such systems. Prior, he was a faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as an assistant professor in 2003. In 2003, he received a Ph.D.\ in Software Engineering from the University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointe's supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER. He was the program co-chair and general chair of several events, including ICPC'20, SANER'15, APSEC'14, and ICSM'13.

[Fabio Petrillo](https://fabiopetrillo.com/) Fabio Petrillo serves as an associate professor in the Department of Software Engineering and IT at École de Technologie Supérieure in Montreal, Canada. He completed his Ph.D.\ in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil in 2016. Following that, he pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at Concordia University in Canada. Throughout his research career, Fabio Petrillo has focused on various areas including Empirical Software Engineering, Software Quality, Debugging, Service-Oriented Architecture, Cloud Computing, and Agile Methods. His contributions to the field of Software Engineering for Computer Games have received international recognition. One of his notable achievements includes the development of Swarm Debugging, an innovative collaborative approach that enhances debugging activities. In addition to his academic pursuits, Fabio Petrillo has accumulated over 20 years of experience working as a software developer, software architect, manager, and agile coach. He has been involved in critical mission projects and provided guidance to numerous teams.

[Cristiano Politowski](https://cpoli.live) is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Université de Montréal, where he is researching machine learning applied to software engineering, in particular game testing. He received his Ph.D.\ degree in Software Engineering from Concordia University, his master's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade de Santa Maria, and his undergrad diploma, also in Computer Science, from the Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, both in Brazil. In industry, he worked with Web applications and the performance of Web servers. -->
