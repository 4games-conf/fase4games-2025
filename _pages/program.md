### Title: Software Ecosystems in Industry

Abstract: The globalization of the software industry creates business opportunities for organizations that acquire and offer IT products and services in several domains, including digital games. However, the growing dependency on the networks of suppliers and external developers to reach organizational objectives and to analyze diversified stakeholders' demands brings several challenges. The reason is the fact that the set of technologies and applications – extensible and/or integrated – forms a common technological platform that joins a community of suppliers, external developers and users, generating networks known as software ecosystems (SECO). An important concern refers to SECO modeling and analysis since IT managers should make decisions based on a systemic perspective. In this talk, we aim to introduce some concepts and factors that affect SECO modeling and analysis in industry. In addition, some SECO implications on the applied software engineering for games will be pointed out.
