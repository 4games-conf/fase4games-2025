# Theme
The Foundations of Applied Software Engineering for Games workshop (FaSE4Games’25) has for goal to share innovative research contributions in software-engineering methods that address the challenges currently facing game development (entertainment games, serious games, and gamified applications).

# Goals
FaSE4Games workshop will gather the community (game researchers, game developers, and educators) and provide a safe space to share contributions and discuss relevant topics to the challenges of game development.

# Topics
Such challenges include, but are not limited to:

- **Artificial intelligence for software engineering** applied to games.
- **Software engineering for artificial intelligence** in games.
- **Debugging and fault localization** applied to games.
- **Distributed and collaborative software engineering** for game development.
- **Empirical software engineering** applied to games.
- **Human and social aspects of software engineering** in game development.
- **Human-computer interaction** in games.
- **Mining software repositories** for game development insights.
- **Mobile game development**.
- **Model-driven engineering** applied to games.
- **Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems** in games.
- **Performance engineering** for games.
- **Program analysis** for games.
- **Program comprehension** in game development.
- **Program repair** in games.
- **Programming languages** for game development.
- **Recommendation systems** in games.
- **Requirements engineering** for games.
- **Search-based software engineering** applied to games.
- **Services, components, and cloud** in game development.
- **Software architectures** for games.
- **Software engineering education** using games.
- **Software evolution** in game development.
- **Software processes** for games.
- **Software testing** for games.
- **Tools and environments** for game development.


# Audience
The targeted audience includes people from the international community in academia or industry with an interest in game development methods from a software engineering perspective. 

The workshop will be open to anyone with related interests (i.e., not restricted to authors/co-authors), including game researchers (students and faculty), developers, and educators. As in previous editions, it will attract a cross-disciplinary, diverse community.

# Workshop Format

FaSE4Games'25 is a **half-day** _hybrid_ workshop. This workshop will be interactive, encourage discussion, and appeal to participants from academia, education, and industry. 

The workshop will feature **one keynote**, short and long presentations with discussions, and a social event to build strong, lasting relationships among participants. 

FaSE4Games'25 provides a forum to explore the challenges that crosscut the software-engineering and game-development communities. The goal of FaSE4Games is to provide a safe space for academic game researchers and commercial game developers to present, discuss, and advance the state-of-the-art relevant to the emerging and current challenges of software engineering for games.

# Paper Selection

The program committee will accept **4-6 long papers** and **6-8 short papers**. 

The page limits are **5 to 8 pages** for short and long papers, respectively. For each accepted paper, we will require at least one author to register, attend, and present.

# Proceedings

The proceedings will appear in the ACM digital library. Consequently, at least one of the authors must register for the workshop.
