# Theme
The Foundations of Applied Software Engineering for Games workshop (FaSE4Games’24) has for goal to share innovative research contributions in software-engineering methods that address the challenges currently facing game development (entertainment games, serious games, and gamified applications).

# Goals
FaSE4Games workshop will gather the community (game researchers, game developers, and educators) and provide a safe space to share contributions and discuss relevant topics to the challenges of game development.

# Topics
Such challenges include, but are not limited to:

* **Artificial intelligence for software engineering** applied to games.
* **Testing and debugging** applied to games.
* **Empirical software engineering** applied to games.
* **Model-driven engineering** applied to games.
* **Performance engineering** applied to games.
* **Program analysis, comprehension, repair, or synthesis** applied to games.
* **Requirements engineering** applied to games.
* **Software architecture** applied to games.
* **Software processes** applied to games.

# Audience
The targeted audience includes people from the international community in academia or industry with an interest in game development methods from a software engineering perspective. 

The workshop will be open to anyone with related interests (i.e., not restricted to authors/co-authors), including game researchers (students and faculty), developers, and educators. As in previous editions, it will attract a cross-disciplinary, diverse community.

# Workshop Format

FaSE4Games'24 is a one-day, hibrid workshop. This workshop will be interactive, encourage discussion, and appeal to participants from academia, education, and industry. 

The workshop will feature **two keynotes** (one industry and one academia), short and long presentations with discussions, and a social event to build strong, lasting relationships among participants. 

FaSE4Games'24 provides a forum to explore the challenges that crosscut the software-engineering and game-development communities. The goal of FaSE4Games is to provide a safe space for academic game researchers and commercial game developers to present, discuss, and advance the state-of-the-art relevant to the emerging and current challenges of software engineering for games.

# Paper Selection

The program committee will accept **four to six long papers** and **six to eight short papers**. 

The page limits are **5 to 8 pages** for short and long papers, respectively. For each accepted paper, we will require at least one author to register, attend, and present.

# Proceedings

The proceedings will appear in the ACM digital library. Consequently, at least one of the authors must register for the workshop.
